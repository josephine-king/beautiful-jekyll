For my Gender and Sexuality in Latin America class, I worked on a group of five to make this [blog](https://reproductivejusticeinlatinamerica.school.blog/) about the history of reproductive rights in Latin America. I contributed to four articles: [Miss Mexico's Gown: Dressing Reproductive Rights as Religious Persecution](https://reproductivejusticeinlatinamerica.school.blog/missmexicosdress/), [Evangelicals and the Future of Abortion Legislation
](https://reproductivejusticeinlatinamerica.school.blog/catholics-and-evangelicals/)
