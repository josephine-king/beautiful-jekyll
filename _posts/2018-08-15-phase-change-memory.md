I spent the summer of 2018 researching phase change memory (PCM), which is an emerging memory technology. To store data, PCM uses a phase change material, which switches between a low-resistance crystalline state and a high-resistance amorphous state. A short, high temperature pulse rearranges the crystal lattice into its high-resistance state, while a long, low temperature pulse allows the material to recrystallize into its low-resistance state. To apply these temperatures, we give the cells voltage pulses of different magnitudes and durations.
