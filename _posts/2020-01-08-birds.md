title: 12 Months of California Birds
---

Over my last winter break of college, I used colored pencils and water color to create a California bird calendar for my mom's birthday. This project was inspired by my mom's love of birds. I learned some cool bird facts along the way, like that the [California scrub jay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_scrub_jay) is thought to be one of the most intelligent animals, and can remember up to 200 food storage locations, along with the food stored there and how fast it's decaying. I also learned that shrikes impale their prey. Here are some photos of a few of the birds I painted, although some of them are incomplete.
