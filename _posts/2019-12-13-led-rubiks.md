I created this LED Rubik's cube with my partner, Aaron Trujillo, as a final project for my Microprocessor-Based Systems and Design class. We had 5 weeks to design and build the project, and had to use both a microcontroller and an FPGA in a meaningful way. Before diving into the technical aspects of our project, I'll briefly explain the concept behind our LED Rubik's Cube.
