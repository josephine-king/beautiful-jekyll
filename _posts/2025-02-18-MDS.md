# State Estimation for Multi-Agent Drone Formation  

# Multidimensional Scaling for Localization  

For this project, my teammate and I worked on reconstructing GPS locations from Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs). We were given two matrices representing distances and travel times between five train stations in the Netherlands. Because the travel time matrix contained noise, our goal was to estimate the original station locations as accurately as possible. This project was entirely simulation-based and implemented in Python and MATLAB.  

## The Problem  

We needed to reconstruct the true positions of train stations using only their pairwise distances. Given that the travel time matrix contained noise due to varying train speeds and curved tracks, we had to develop an algorithm robust to this uncertainty.  

## The Approach  

Our work was inspired by the paper *Euclidean Distance Matrices: Essential Theory, Algorithms, and Applications* by Dokmanic et al. ([link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7276787)). We implemented and compared three different methods:  

- **Classical Multidimensional Scaling (MDS):** Uses eigenvalue decomposition to reconstruct positions from a distance matrix.  
- **Convex Optimization (CVX):** Reformulates MDS as an optimization problem and solves it using semidefinite programming.  
- **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD):** A gradient-based method to iteratively optimize the position estimates while enforcing constraints.  

## The Results  

All three methods successfully estimated the station locations, but their performance varied:  

- Classical MDS worked well on the noiseless distance matrix but struggled with the noisy travel time data.  
- CVX and PGD performed better on noisy data by incorporating constraints and optimization techniques.  
- CVX converged in just 11 iterations and was robust to initial conditions.  
- PGD was slightly faster in execution time but required careful tuning of parameters.  

## Key Takeaways  

This project highlighted the trade-offs between classical MDS and optimization-based approaches. While MDS is simple and effective for clean data, convex optimization and gradient descent methods provide better robustness to noise.
