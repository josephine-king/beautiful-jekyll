My name is Josephine King and I'm a senior at Harvey Mudd, which is a small STEM liberal arts college in Claremont, CA. I'm majoring in engineering, with a focus in electrical engineering, and I'm currently looking for a full-time job with a starting date in early July 2020. My interests include robotics and control theory, digital and analog design, and history. Click through my blog to read about some of my favorite projects and interests!
