Hi! I’m a first-year MSc student in Electrical Engineering at TU Delft, specializing in the Signals and Systems track. My academic interests lie in controls, signal processing, and optimization, and I’m particularly passionate about applying these fields to sustainability and renewable energy. I'm currently looking for an internship (Summer/Fall 2025) and master's thesis (Fall 2025/Spring 2026). On this website, you can find my CV, projects, and contact information. Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit for your team!

Before my master’s, I worked at Apple for four years doing design verification for the Apple Neural Engine. Before that, I earned my undergraduat in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College in 2020. In my free time, I love drawing, painting, and visiting museums. I also enjoy yoga, weightlifting, and Sally Rooney novels.
